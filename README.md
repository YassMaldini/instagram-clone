<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

It's a revisited version of the instagram's mobile app based on the same API as the real app. 

This project is still in progress and a lot of features are missing.

Main problems I encountered:
* The first issue was to access the mobile API, to do it I had to go through these steps:
  * Disable SSL pinning from the instagram's apk to prepare MitM
  * Set up a remote MitM on my desktop
  * Root an android phone to access the system files and place in it the MitM certificate and run a frida server
* The second one was to reproduce properly the functionning of the app, particulary the way to manage the API
* The only issue I wasn't able to resolve in the way I wanted is the password encryption. So to handle it I created a remote API using node.js to have access to the built-in crypto module. <br />
  You can also take a look at `https://insta-auth.herokuapp.com/encrypt_password/:password` which is an endpoint to encrypt a password in the same way as instagram.

An online demo is available but you can contact me to test it on a real device using Testflight for iOS or an apk build for android.
